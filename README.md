# pb-youtube-widget
This is a widget that plays Youtube videos from the PotteryBarn Youtube channel. The playlist container below the Youtube player loads more videos as you scroll.

This widget uses the Youtube player API and the Youtube data api v3, and html and css code from PotteryBarn.com for the header and footer.

It was written in html, css, and Javascript with no additional libraries -- not even jQuery.
